# Kronos coin
Kronos coin is the next generation Cryptocurrency to provide transactions at scale.

Kronos coin is a digital currency that is desinged for speed. Transaction speed, and verification speed, enabling it to be used in a global commercial market.

The problem with most crypto currencies is they are not capable of handling large numbers of transactions per second. For example the Visa Network processes over 1700 transactions per second on average wheras Bitcoin can only process 5 transactions per second. I personally had to wait 48 hours for one of my transactions to appear on an exchange after sending it. Ethereum isnt much better at 10-20 transactions per second. Its sort oflike a kid showing up to the Indy 500 with a tricyle. No contest. 

To my knowledge all crypto currencies currently on the market are a joke when comparing it to a network like Visa.

Many countries are considering using a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). But most likely they will be centralized, and payments will be censorable. 

The purpose of this project is to produce a digital currency that can scale like a Visa type network and provide uncensorable decentralized payments for the masses. Thus there is a need for this project.
